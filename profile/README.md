# Welcome!

Below you'll find a series of challenges, videos and documents to help you become a better developer. These tutorials for the most part do not have training wheels.

So what does that mean?

There are no answer sheets here or paint by numbers assignments. What you will find are apps with broken or incomplete features that you will need to build through a combination of research, watching videos and reaching out via Slack!

**You will find instructions in the README.md** files of each of these projects as well as additonal challenges like recording a video of a difficult concept. You'd be surprised how much you will learn from recording yourself attempting to explain something you think you know üòâ.

**Please reach out over Slack when (not if) you run into issues or are stuck.**

If you find an issue or have a suggestion to improve a challenge please email me at brianjeney83@gmail.com or simply make a pull request.

**Good luck and happy coding!**
